#### Naming Convention

Use Descriptive Names:

Choose meaningful and descriptive names that reflect the purpose of the variable or function. Avoid vague names like x or data, unless in very localized contexts.
Consistent Naming Style:

Stick to a naming style throughout your codebase. For Python, the most common styles are:
Snake Case (snake_case) for functions, variables, and method names.
Pascal Case (PascalCase) for class names.
Upper Case (UPPER_CASE) for constants.
Avoid Using Digits in Names:

Adding numbers to variable names (like data1, data2, ...) can often be replaced with more descriptive names or by using lists or dictionaries.
Limit the Use of Abbreviations:

Unless the abbreviation is well-known (like http or db), prefer full words that make the names understandable without context.
Avoid Name Collisions and Keywords:

Do not use names that collide with Python keywords (like list, str, or def). If necessary, append an underscore (_) to differentiate them, e.g., list_.
Use Prefixes for Boolean Variables:

Prefix Boolean variables with is, has, or can to make it clear they are Booleans, e.g., is_visible, has_children.
Private and "Protected" Object Names:

Use a single underscore (_) to indicate that a variable or method should be treated as "protected" (i.e., not part of the public API of a class/module).
Use double underscores (__) to avoid name clashes in subclasses (known as name mangling).
Function Names Should Imply Action:

Since functions usually perform actions, their names should reflect this by starting with a verb, e.g., calculate_total, process_data.
Avoid Redundancy in Names:

Do not repeat the name of the class in a property or method. For example, instead of car.get_car_mileage(), use car.get_mileage().
Namespace Packaging:

Use namespaces (module and package names) wisely to group related classes and functions, which helps in organizing the code better and makes it easier to understand.
